This project is a guide from the odin project.  This should put together everything I've learned so far, even creating this text file.  This should cover using everything from creating WSL2 to manipulating files in the terminal and connecting to github.  Being able to create the recipes on website and push to git.  Committing the different versions along the way and having all of the images and links inside the project work.
